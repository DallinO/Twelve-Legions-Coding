## **Q: Tell me about yourself.**

I recently graduated with a degree in Software Engineering with an emphasis on design and supplementary work in embedded systems. I've been exploring roles in the space and defense sector because I grew up in the Air Force and developed a love for aeronautical and aerospace technologies. I am currently finishing an internship position working as a software engineer assisting in the development of a customer tracking and service call scheduling application for an HVAC company. In my role, I assisted in working directly with the clients in determining the requirements for the application and the initial designs. Afterwards, I have been working on the core functionality implementation.

Beyond academics, I’ve worked on several self-directed projects in my commitment to continuous learning. One such project is the Tessera Daily Planner, a Blazor Web App with API. I also developed a rudimentary aerial drone simulator where I worked on implementing realistic physics and motion dynamics in C++ with Simple and Fast Multimedia Library for graphical rendering.

I see Northrop as the kind of place that fosters continuous learning and actively encourages team collaboration given its contract work and mission objectives.



## **Q: Where do you see yourself in five years?**

In the next few years, I see myself having advanced into a level II position where I’ll have taken on greater responsibility in designing and implementing solutions, collaborating more closely with cross-functional teams, and possibly mentoring newer engineers. I’m eager to deepen my expertise in design, working on higher-level system development.

Beyond that, I’d like to continue building on my leadership skills and technical proficiency so I can transition into a level III role. My goal would be to lead more complex projects and contribute to architectural decisions. Ultimately, I want to be recognized not only for my coding and problem-solving abilities but also for my ability to guide and support others.



## **\*Q: Tell me about a time when you faced a challenging situation at work. How did you handle it?**

During my internship, we encountered an issue where the data transfer between components such as the API and front-end was causing a lot of issues. Originally, we were passing data through JObjects and had to parse and cast data into the right structures. This led to many potential exceptions. After some research, I implemented a more robust data handling mechanism that reduced the number of exceptions and improved overall data integrity.

Additionally, the initial database design couldn’t support complex scheduling requirements. To address this, I led the analysis and proposed a redesigned, normalized database structure. I updated the SRS, coordinated the implementation with the team, and developed additional unit tests using xUnit and Moq to ensure 80% code coverage. Despite the challenge, we completed the redesign within the sprint timeline, meeting all functionality requirements and ensuring client satisfaction with the final product.



## **Q: Describe a time when you worked as part of a team. What was your role?**

I’ve had the opportunity to work on several teams, each under unique circumstances, which gave me a variety of experiences. In my Data Structures course, I partnered with a classmate to develop custom data structures from scratch in C++ using pair programming techniques. It was my first exposure to pair programming, and I gained a real appreciation for how collaborative problem-solving can improve code quality and efficiency.

For larger teams, I worked on a Design Patterns project where we collaborated as equals without a designated leader, making decisions unanimously as a group. It taught me how to navigate shared responsibility and ensure everyone’s voice was heard.

In my Architectural Design course, I was part of a large-scale project where the entire class worked on a single software system. We had a hierarchical structure with a project manager overseeing over a dozen teams. I was the team lead for the Component Design team, which gave me experience coordinating within my team, collaborating with other team leads, and reporting to the project manager.

During my internship, I worked directly with the stakeholder, who gave me the chance to lead communication with third-party contributors and clients. This experience helped me refine my communication skills, particularly when working with seasoned professionals and non-technical clients.



## **Q: Give an example of a time you took the initiative.**

In my Architecture Design course, I was part of a Component Design team responsible for breaking down our system into modules and establishing clear interfaces between them. While we had a strong group of individuals, we struggled initially because no one was quite sure how to begin separating the components or defining the interface patterns. This led to indecision and stalled progress.

My goal was to help the team overcome this uncertainty, establish a clear plan for component separation, and create a workflow that would keep everyone aligned on tasks and deadlines.

I took the initiative by first outlining our high-level requirements and objectives for the system. From there, I proposed a set of guidelines on how each component should be designed and how the interfaces should interact. To keep us organized, I set up a Trello board integrated with Jira, where tasks could be assigned and managed. This served as the basis for checking progress in our weekly meetings where we could make any necessary adjustments.

Once we had a clear framework, our productivity significantly increased. We were able to finalize our component designs and interfaces more efficiently and stayed on track with our deadlines. By the end of the project, we had a well-structured architecture that the entire team felt confident in, and our professor commended us on our effective collaboration and organization.



## **Q: What skill do you have that sets you apart?**

I’ve worked a lot with C++, especially through my Aerial Drone Simulator project and other personal and academic work. I’ve gotten pretty comfortable building both common and custom data structures, which has really sharpened my problem-solving skills.

My focus in school was on software design, so I’ve learned a lot about how large-scale systems are structured and managed. I understand things like system architecture, testing, quality assurance, and project management, and I’ve worked with SDLC and Agile methodologies, which helps me contribute effectively to bigger projects.

I’m also great in team settings. I’ve worked on plenty of group projects in school and as part of the Computing Society, so I know how to navigate project hierarchies and collaborate with other teams. I’m good at communicating in different formats, handling tough conversations when needed, and building connections quickly with others.

On top of that, I’m pretty adaptable. I pick up new things fast and can adjust easily when project goals or priorities change. I think that’s especially important in tech since things are always evolving.



## **Q: Describe a time you made a mistake. How did you handle it?**

During my Design Patterns course, I was part of a team where one of my teammates took on the unofficial role of team lead. We set up a shared Google Doc for collaboration and communicated through Teams. For our first assignment, I decided to take on most of the work myself because I didn’t fully trust my teammates to produce quality results. I spent several hours working on the design, but then I suddenly couldn’t access the document anymore.

When I checked my Teams messages, I realized my teammates had been discussing and dividing up tasks while I was working in isolation. I had essentially overwritten their contributions without realizing it. The team lead had tried reaching out to me multiple times, but since I wasn’t paying attention, they decided to temporarily block my access to the document to avoid further confusion.

As soon as I realized what had happened, I immediately apologized to the team, took full accountability, and worked to rebuild trust. From that point on, we communicated more effectively and ended up working really well together for the rest of the project.

That experience taught me an important lesson: I can’t just try to do everything myself to fast-track a project. I need to trust my teammates, give them the space to do their work, and embrace the process of team collaboration. In the end, I’ve learned that working together makes everything easier and leads to better results.



## **\*Q: Tell me about a time when you successfully met a tight deadline.**

During my senior project, I had already met both the core and some extra requirements before presenting to my professor. However, he felt the project needed an additional feature to fully demonstrate my capabilities.

**Task**

I had only two days left before the final deadline to implement a completely new feature. Missing this opportunity would limit my grade potential.

**Action**

Over that weekend, I dedicated long hours to design and integrate the additional functionality. I prioritized efficiency, tested thoroughly, and kept detailed notes to ensure quality under tight time constraints.

**Result**

I successfully delivered the enhanced project on time. This not only met my professor’s expectations but also demonstrated my ability to adapt quickly and work diligently under pressure. While we hope that we are not placed in such situations, they do arise, and I think it's important that you have people capable of putting in those long hours and grinding to meet deadlines on short notice.



## **Q: What are your greatest strengths?**

I’m highly persistent and committed to continuous learning. When I’m given a task or responsibility, I see it through to completion and take full accountability for my work—no excuses, no shifting blame. One often overlooked aspect of problem-solving is the perseverance to follow through once you’ve found a solution. I bring that perseverance, even if it means redesigning significant parts of a system or tackling a completely unfamiliar technology.

In an industry that evolves as quickly as ours, it’s essential to have engineers who are never complacent. I’m always looking for ways to expand my skill set, researching new tools, techniques, and technologies that can provide an edge. Whether it’s learning a new programming language or adopting a novel framework, I’m eager to do what it takes to stay at the forefront of innovation.

## **Q: What is your biggest weakness, and how are you addressing it?**

One of my biggest weaknesses is trying to implement too fast. This really became apparent to me while working on my senior project where I wasn’t part of a team that could help provide guidance and set a pace. I knew in my mind what I wanted the final product to be, so I would program a large chunk, adding several components and features at a time before testing, which led to unnecessary excess debugging time. I instead should have focused on core requirement functionality and implemented requirements one at a time, testing after each addition. To address this, I started by changing my mindset to be more patient and prioritize flawless functionality over having many rich features.



## **\*Q: How do you handle stress or pressure?**

I handle stress and pressure by breaking a problem down into manageable steps and creating a schedule to track progress and ensure proper time management. It's important to celebrate the small accomplishments in order to maintain a positive attitude.



## **\*Q: What would you do if you disagreed with your supervisor's decision?**

If I disagreed with my supervisor's decision, I would express my dissent in a professional way to ensure they are considering every option and point of view before making a decision. If others feel the same way as me, I think expressing our opposition together would also help to communicate that the decision made does not fully reflect the views of the team. However, ultimately, I would respect the supervisor's decision.



## **\*Q: How would you manage conflicting priorities on a project?**

If there are conflicting priorities on a project, I would try to see if it is possible to prioritize one over the other and work on them sequentially. If not, then I would be sure to outline the steps needed to accomplish each and balance my time working between the tasks. If I have others working on the same tasks, then we may also be able to split the tasks.



## **\*Q: What type of work environment do you thrive in?**

## **\*Q: What is your process for debugging a complex problem?**

The first step is to understand and consistently reproduce the issue. This might involve setting up a controlled environment or simulating specific inputs or conditions that trigger the problem.

**Gather Information:**

I examine error logs, system outputs, and any available diagnostic tools to gather as much context as possible. If the problem occurs in a specific part of the code, I focus my attention there.

**Simplify the Scope:**

Next, I try to isolate the issue by narrowing down the affected area. This involves breaking the problem into smaller, more manageable components and testing them individually.

**Formulate Hypotheses:**

Based on the information gathered, I make educated guesses about potential causes. For example, I might consider recent changes in the code, edge cases, or dependency issues.

**Test and Verify:**

I implement small changes or experiments to confirm or rule out each hypothesis. For instance, I might use print statements, debug tools, or unit tests to trace the program's behavior.

**Implement a Solution:**

Once I've identified the root cause, I develop and test a fix to ensure it resolves the issue without introducing new ones.

**Document and Reflect:**

Finally, I document the problem, its cause, and the solution for future reference. If applicable, I also take steps to prevent similar issues, such as adding additional test cases or improving code clarity.
